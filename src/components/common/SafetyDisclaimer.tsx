          Book Swap Jerusalem is a goodwill-based platform. When meeting to exchange books, 
          please take common safety precautions: meet in public places during daylight hours, 
          tell someone where you're going, and trust your instincts. We recommend initial 
          meetings at caf√©s, libraries, or other public venues.
